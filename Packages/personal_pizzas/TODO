TODO:

ghost pepper:
  rescue
    bonus points: mark the location of the error
soup:
  move to gap:
    up should leave cursor at soft BOL, especially with extend on
    --
    option to only match lines at the same indentation
  smartnewline:
    if next line has stuff on it,
      option to not newline but insert whitespace upto the appropriate column
      ex: this_is(the: current_line)        # I'm pressing enter here
          even.tho(this.is.here)            # cursor ends up here
      shift+enter for this ^^
    also,
      there's potential to be smart about jumping outof the middle of a comment
  delete to:
    ctrl+super+delete to delete to soft bol
  add line:
    multiple cursors on the same line probably wants to make many newlines
  controlled way to clear all but one cursor
  --
  fancy copy:
    research putting delimeters between regions
      the paste commands are not smart enough when pasting multiline regions

fancy:
  find_under:
    option to only select whole words
      use case: selection is a whole word (thing)
                but results find it used as part of a word (thing_factory)
  upcase and downcase with empty selector:
    change case of the word the cursor is in without affecting the cursor
    maybe this has an option for toggling between snake and title too
  same idea as ^^ but convert to ruby symbol
  --
  duplicate:
    super+d context selection not empty:
      dup the selection onto a new line (instead of in place)
      consider putting it on the preceding line?

general:
  investigate super+[ and clean up commands to improve it

bakewell:
  join also lets us modify each string
    eg add colon before each to change variable names into symbols

new ideas:
  keep column markers using similar tech to the groups
